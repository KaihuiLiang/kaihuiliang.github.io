# About

I'm an incoming Research Associate at Columbia Business School working with Professor Sandra Matz, beginning August 2025. I was a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Columbia University. My research focuses on human-centered AI systems that support **well-being**, **learning**, and **meaningful connection**—with a particular emphasis on creating intelligent conversational interfaces that make real-world impact in people's lives.

## Research Vision
I'm passionate about designing technology that supports **personal growth** and **mental health**, especially for people navigating vulnerable moments in their lives. My approach centers on creating psychologically safe digital spaces where authentic transformation can occur—not just symptom management, but genuine growth through honest self-confrontation and healthy belief reconstruction.

Rather than providing superficial encouragement, I believe effective support systems should help users authentically engage with difficult realities, identify underlying patterns that limit their growth, and develop resilience based on truth and genuine understanding.

## Research Experience & Expertise

My work spans **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Human-Centered AI**, **Conversational AI**, **Conversational User Interfaces**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, integrating methods from behavioral science and communication research. During my doctoral studies at Columbia University, I conducted research on intelligent conversational systems across areas including **healthy lifestyle behavior change**, **educational technologies**, and **human-chatbot interaction**. I've published research in leading venues including CSCW, Digital Health, CUI, ACL, SIGDial, and Frontiers in Communication.

A pivotal experience was leading UC Davis's finalist team in the Amazon Alexa Prize Socialbot Challenge, where I directed a 13-member interdisciplinary team to build and deploy a conversational AI system used by thousands of people. This experience deepened my understanding of the complexity involved in creating technology that feels genuinely helpful rather than merely functional, and reinforced the importance of cross-functional collaboration in building systems that truly serve human needs.

## Industry Experience

Earlier in my career, I worked as a software engineer specializing in Android development, where I participate cross-platform application development from concept to deployment in a startup environment. This experience in building user-centered products at scale continues to inform my research approach, ensuring that my work addresses real-world technical constraints and user needs.


## Philosophy

I believe research in HCI should be an expression of our values—not merely a way to publish papers, but a contribution to human flourishing. This conviction shapes how I approach collaboration: creating psychological safety, practicing deep listening, and maintaining authentic connection even when navigating technical challenges.

Great technology doesn't just process information—it holds space for transformation. It doesn't just solve problems—it nurtures the human spirit. My goal is to build systems that serve as bridges to human flourishing, not barriers.

## Collaboration

I seek collaborators who share this vision: to create technology that not only works, but enlightens and transforms. Whether you're interested in research partnerships, mentorship opportunities, or meaningful conversations about human-centered technology, I'm always open to connecting with others who care deeply about supporting human flourishing through our work.
